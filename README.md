Multiple Linear Regression Model used to accurately assess a stock's price. There is a built in GUI as well, to allow easy user access to the model.


# Statistical Models
This repository contains a variety of statistical modeling projects that leverage a host of machine learning methods in order to derive meaningful results from topics ranging from politics to finance.

## Table of Contents

1. **Asset Pricing Model**
- The aim of this project is to determine the integral of a continuous function given only discrete data with noise that is collected at N different steps along the function's interval. A Gaussian Process is used to fit a curve as well as a confidence interval to the data produced from the noisy function, and then the Trapezoidal Rule is used to take the integral of this newly created function, since the curve fitted by the Gaussian Process is discrete. 
2. **Predicting the Results of the 2020 Presidential Election**
- There are two projects contained in this folder. The first aims to explore the various numerical differentiation methods that one can use in order to solve the heat equation, and compares the stability of each method. The second project implements the Peaceman Rachford ADI method from scratch on the heat equation, graphs the results in three dimensions, and performs a Resolution Study in order to check for bugs and verify the accuracy of the method.

## Summary
 
**Classifying Patients as Diabetic or Not Based using Machine Learning**
- The aim of this project was very simple, it was to take the results to yes/no questions that patients were asked, and then based on their answers, determine if the patient has diabetes or not. In order to accomplish this, I chose to construct three different classification algorithms, and then see how each one would perform in determining if a patient is diabetic.
- The layout of the project is as follows.
  - Reading in the data
  - Cleaning the Data
  - Observing the relationship between variables using Correlation Matrix
  - Constructing a Decision Tree and analysing the results
  - Constructing a K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and analysing the results
  - Constructing a Random Forest and analysing the results
    1) Random Forest hyperparameters selected using Grid Search CV
    2) Random Forest hyperparameters selected using Bayesian Optimization CV
    3) Comparison of results and analysis
- The .ipynb file is done in Jupyter Notebook so it was easy to comment in cells between lines of code, as well as write up my thought process as I went along, so the code file itself will serve as a much better guide to the project than the bullet points that summarize it here. So click the link to the code and enjoy.

## Summary
 
**Classifying the Titanic's Passengers Survival Odds using Logistic Regression**
- The aim of this project was to utilize the manifest data from the Titanic, which reveales attributes of each passenger such as their age, gender, ticket fare, and boarding class among other things, in order to determine if they survived or not that fateful night. The model in use here is Logistic Regression, and since it assigns survival probabilities to each individual passenger, it allows us to see a better picture of not just whether or not a given passenger survived, but just how sure we are that they did or didn't.
- The layout of the project is as follows.
  - Reading in the data
  - Splitting up the data for training and testing
  - Observing the relationship between variables using a Correlation Matrix
  - Tuning the hyperparameter "C"
  - Fitting our model, and deriving overall accuracy of our model
  - Comparing this accuracy to Dummy Classifiers for comparison
  - Constructing an ROC curve for our classifier
  - Visually interpreting the results of our model
  - Taking a deeper dive into where the model messed up the strongest
- The .ipynb file is done in Jupyter Notebook so it was easy to comment in cells between lines of code, as well as write up my thought process as I went along, so the code file itself will serve as a much better guide to the project than the bullet points that summarize it here. So click the link to the code and enjoy.

## Summary
 
**Building Gaussian Process From Scratch To Find Maximum of System**
- The aim of this project was to better understand the Gaussian Process by building it from scratch, and using it to see if we can find the maximum of a continuous function as efficiently as possible in order to minimize our time exploring and maximize our time exploiting.
- The layout of the project is as follows.
  - Generating some random continuous function with endpoints zero
  - Select some points randomly on the function to establish known values
  - Build a Gaussian Process using these known values, then select a new point on our function by using the portions of our Gaussian Process that have the potential to be greater than our current known maximum, and repeat this until we find the maximum of the known function.
  - This is not always a guaranteed strategy to find the maximum of the function, however when we have to balance the cost that comes with gathering each additional data point, this is definitely a strategy to consider.
- The .ipynb file is done in Jupyter Notebook so it was easy to comment in cells between lines of code, as well as write up my thought process as I went along, so the code file itself will serve as a much better guide to the project than the bullet points that summarize it here. So click the link to the code and enjoy.

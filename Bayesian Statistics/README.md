## Summary
 
**Building Bayesian Linear Regresssion From Scratch**
- The aim of this project was to better understand Bayesian Linear Regression by building it from scratch, and comparing how it works to that of Ordinary Linear Regression.
- The layout of the project is as follows.
  - Generating some random data from a line
  - Fitting an Oridnary Linear Regression (OLR) to it as well as a Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR)
  - Seeing the quality of fit using OLR as well as BLR when only given a subset of the total data points generated from the line
  - Seeing BLR converging upon the exact same line as OLR once the total number of data points becomes sufficiently large
  - A small write up on my thoughts as well as the strengths and weaknesses of OLR v BLR
- The .ipynb file is done in Jupyter Notebook so it was easy to comment in cells between lines of code, as well as write up my thought process as I went along, so the code file itself will serve as a much better guide to the project than the bullet points that summarize it here. So click the link to the code and enjoy.
